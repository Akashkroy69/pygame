# Flappy Bird Game with Pygame

![Flappy Bird](flappy_bird.png)

A simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development.

## How to Play

- **Spacebar**: Make the bird fly and avoid pipes.
- **Avoid Pipes**: Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. If not, you can install Pygame using:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-pygame.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd flappy-bird-pygame
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python flappy_bird.py
```

## Gameplay

- The bird falls due to gravity. Press the spacebar to make the bird fly.
- Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.
- Pipes will continuously appear, so be attentive!

## Game Structure

1. **Bird Class (`Bird`):**
   - Represents the player-controlled bird.
   - Handles bird animation, gravity, and flying logic.
   - Uses sprite functionality for easy integration with Pygame.

2. **Pipe Class (`Pipe`):**
   - Represents the pipes that the bird must navigate through.
   - Handles the continuous generation of pipes and their movement.
   - Uses sprite functionality for easy integration with Pygame.

3. **Game Loop (`while runningStatus`):**
   - Manages the main game loop, updating and rendering game elements.
   - Handles user input, including spacebar presses for bird control.
   - Controls the continuous appearance and movement of pipes.
